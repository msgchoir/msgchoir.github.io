If you touch on that round shape in the screen (blank&white overlapped circles), your phone will "fire" sounds like "BLACK!", "WHITE!" etc.

Concerning dichotomy and exclusion..

### More to say...

- If your phone seems too slow, try BnW-SoundGun-simple.mmp which has less load on animation.

- Hacking course(?) : You can record your own sounds up to 10 replacing ones that is already in. Touch the circular icon with 'i' in the center at top/left of the screen. Select 'bnwgrab10.mmp' at the very end of the list. **No documentation** is ready for now afterwards. So kinda little hacking required. One critical hint is that the recording works only after you touch 'menu/new sound.' This could be a bit confusing but to stop troubles from unexpected touches.
